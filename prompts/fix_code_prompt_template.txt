You are an expert Python data scientist. The following Python code, intended to create surrogate features for a pandas DataFrame, failed during execution.

Original Task Context:
The goal was to create new host-only features for the task: {task_description}
The host data contains native numeric features like:
{host_native_numeric_features_schema}
And native categorical features like:
{host_native_categorical_features_schema}
The surrogate features should be derived ONLY from these available host features.
The KB insights that inspired these surrogates were: {kb_insights_summary}

Faulty Python Code:
```python
{faulty_code}
Error Message/Traceback from Execution:
{error_message}
Please analyze the faulty code and the error message. Provide a corrected version of the Python code.
The corrected code should define one or more functions, with the main function being apply_surrogates(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame.
This function takes a pandas DataFrame df as input and should return the DataFrame with the new or corrected surrogate columns added.
Ensure the corrected code:

Addresses the error(s) indicated.
Only uses columns present in the input DataFrame (as per the schema context provided).
Handles potential division by zero or missing values gracefully.
Creates new columns with clear, descriptive names, preferably prefixed with surr_.
Is well-commented.

Return only the corrected Python code block, enclosed in python ... ```.
